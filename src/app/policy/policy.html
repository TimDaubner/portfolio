    <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other
        places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be
        transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other
        governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to
        that transfer.</p>
    <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or
        a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal
        information.</p>
    <h4>Delete Your Personal Data</h4>

    <h4>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h4>
    <h5>Business Transactions</h5>

    <h5>Law enforcement</h5>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by
        law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>

        to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child
        has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data
        from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that
        information from Our servers.</p>
    <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent
        from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
